## My process

First I created the html tags.:
- Added a <section>.
- Within the section, I nested two <div> one for the QR image and another for the description.
- Finally, inside the second "div" I nested an <h2> and a <p> with the values that FrontEnd Mentor gave me.
  
Then I started with the styles:
- For this I created a file "style.css" in which I introduced all the necessary styles.
- Set the margins and padding to zero.
- Initially formatted the html and the body.
- I gave the necessary sizes to the section, the image container and the description container.
- Added the image as the background of the image contender.
- And I formatted the texts.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
